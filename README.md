# AutoMod

AutoMod is a moderation/utility bot for both large & small servers written in Python3!

### How can I add the bot?

Feel free to invite the bot by clicking [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=697487580522086431&scope=bot&permissions=403041534). Note that the bot will need certain permissions in order to work. I'd suggest enabling the "administrator" permissions for its role. If you don't want to do that, simply give it the perms you are comfortable with giving it.

### Are there any other important links?

Yes:
- [Website](https://automod-beta.ezzz1337.repl.co/) currently just more of a playground (aka beta)
- [Support Server](https://discord.gg/S9BEBux) for news, updates, downtimes and general help with the bot
- [Top.gg Page](https://top.gg/bot/697487580522086431/vote) for voting and supporting the bot (free of course), thanks to everyone doing it!
